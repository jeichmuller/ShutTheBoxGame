# ShutTheBoxGame
## Based off the board game Shut the Box


## Rules:
    The rules of Shut The Box are simple! The game is played in a small box that has tiles labeled 1-9. Each of these tiles can either be in the "up" position or the "down" position. When the game starts all tiles are "up" and the goal is to "shut" the box (or flip down every tile). You will roll 2 die, and get a total, with that given total you can choose which tiles you'd like to shut. But you can only use each number tile once, and the total of the tiles you shut must equal the dice roll.
